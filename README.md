# My-Workday-Scheduler
Description:
Creat a workday planner that you can save events in for each hour of the day. These events should be saved to local Storage and persist upon page refresh. The timeblocks on the schedule should dynamically change style color for (past, present & future) based on what time it is currently. 

This web application was created using the knowledge gained throughout the course but specifically from the week 5 content which includes the use of Jquery and Web APIs. This week's challenge also used a lot of tools learned in week 4 pertaining to saving to local storage and retrieving this data and rendering on the page.
